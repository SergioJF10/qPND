### Hybrid Algorithm for detecting prime numbers.
 
Project developed as end-of-course project in _Quantum Software Development Course_ from _Escuela Superior de Informatica - UCLM_.

The main idea is to develop, by means of one (or more) quantum algorithm -and classic software if needed- a Prime Number Detector (PND).
